# THE WHY FOR EVERTHING ???

Alright, so picture this: I'm in college, and they've banned smartphones like they're ancient relics. Social media? Forget about itâ€”blocked harder than a spam caller. But, in a twist of fate, the college Wi-Fi is still down with Firebase Cloud. So, I thought, "Why not pull a tech Houdini and create a web app with Next.js and Firebase?" Now, even with the Wi-Fi that's slower than a sloth on a lazy day, we can chat and set up private sessions with our hostel buddies. Take that, no-smartphone rule!
